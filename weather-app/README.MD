# Weather API calls

This is just a simple Node.js project which uses [weatherstack API](weatherstack.com) to provide the weather and [mapbox API](mapbox.com) to geo-code the provided address/location.
In the webserver project these API calls were used to fetch the data. 

This project was created to learn basics of Nodejs and request. The following concepts were learnt during the development of this application.

## Concepts Learnt & Implemented 

* Asynchronous Basics
* Call Stack, Callback Queue & Event Loop
* HTTP requests
* Callback functions
* Callback Chaining
* Object Property shorthand & object destructuring
